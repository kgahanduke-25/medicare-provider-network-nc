## Project Overview

This project builds a **provider co-practice network** for the state of North Carolina using publicly available CMS data from the:

**Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners – by Provider (2023)**  
(Data are public but not redistributed here per CMS guidelines.)

The goal is to demonstrate:
1. Network-analytic skills using open health services data  
2. Identification of provider hubs at the ZIP-code level  
3. Visualization of a major care cluster — **ZIP 27710 (Duke Health System)**  
4. Creation of a clean, reproducible workflow for GitHub  

This project is designed to reflect quantitative and computational skills relevant for **PhD applications in Epidemiology, Health Services Research, and Quantitative Biomedical Sciences**.

**Notice:**  
The raw CMS dataset (`Medicare_Physician_Other_Practitioners_by_Provider_2023.csv`) is **excluded** from GitHub following CMS policy.

## 🔍 Methods

### **1. Data Source**
Public CMS provider-level data containing:
- National Provider Identifier (NPI)
- Provider state and ZIP-5
- Number of Medicare beneficiaries served (Tot_Benes)

### **2. Network Construction**
A provider–provider edge is created **when two providers are located in the same ZIP code**.

**Edge weight formula:**

\[w_{ij} = \frac{1}{1 + | \text{benes}_i - \text{benes}_j |}
\]

Where:
- \( \text{benes}_i \) = Medicare beneficiaries seen by provider *i*
- Higher weight → providers treat similar volumes of patients

##  Key Results

### **1. Largest Provider Hubs in NC**
Based on number of providers per ZIP:

| ZIP | Providers | Interpretation |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| **27157** | 1317 | Large Winston–Salem clinical cluster |
| **27834** | 1302 | Greenville (ECU Health hub) |
| **27710** | **1118** | **Duke Health System hub** |
| **28204** | 1081 | Charlotte medical cluster |
| **27103** | 1210 | Wake Forest hub |

## Main Network Visualization (Duke / ZIP 27710)

![Network 27710](https://github.com/kgahanduke-25/medicare-provider-network-nc/blob/main/3.network_zip_27710_duke_hub.png)


**Interpretation:**
- Dark blue nodes = highest co-practice strength
- Indicates highly interconnected clinical ecosystem around Duke Hospital
- Densely connected core (tertiary & specialty care)
- Peripheral clusters represent subspecialties or satellite clinics

##  Degree & Strength Distributions

### Strength distribution  
![Strength](https://github.com/kgahanduke-25/medicare-provider-network-nc/blob/main/5.strength_distribution_zip_27710.png)


Higher strength = providers practicing in parallel with very similar beneficiary volumes.

##  Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:
- Handling **1.25 million+ provider records**
- Cleaning and reshaping administrative CMS data
- Constructing a **10 million–edge** provider network
- Computing **network centrality metrics** (degree, strength)
- Producing publication-quality visualization
- Documentation & reproducibility using GitHub
