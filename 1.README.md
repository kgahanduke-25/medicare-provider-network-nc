# Medicare Provider Network in North Carolina (CMS 2023)
*A data-driven map of clinical collaboration across North Carolina Medicare providers (CMS 2023)*

## Project Overview

This project constructs a **provider co-practice network** for the entire state of North Carolina using the publicly available:

**Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners – by Provider (2023) dataset (CMS)**  
*(Raw data not redistributed here per CMS policy.)*

The network identifies:
1. **Major provider hubs** at the ZIP-code level  
2. **The most connected clinical ecosystem** in the state: **ZIP 27710 (Duke Health System)**  
3. Network centrality patterns in Medicare service delivery  
4. A clean, fully reproducible workflow for health services analytics using R

## Methods

### **1. Data Source**
Public CMS provider-level data containing:
Variables used:
- **Rndrng_NPI** — National Provider Identifier  
- **Rndrng_Prvdr_State**  
- **Rndrng_Prvdr_Zip5**  
- **Tot_Benes** — number of Medicare beneficiaries seen  
-R , package versions (e.g., igraph, tidyverse, ggplot2).

### **2. Preprocessing Notes**
- Removed ZIP codes with invalid formatting (non-5-digit or 00000)  
- Converted NPIs to character strings  
- Excluded ZIPs with **only one provider** (cannot form a network)  
- Ensured beneficiary counts were numeric and non-missing  

### **3. Network Construction**
A provider–provider edge is created **if two providers practice in the same ZIP code**.

The network is:
- **Undirected**
- **Weighted**
- **ZIP-cluster based**

### **Edge weight formula**

\[
w_{ij} = \frac{1}{1 + | \text{benes}_i - \text{benes}_j |}
\]
Meaning:
- Providers treating **similar caseloads** have **stronger ties**
- Providers with very different service volumes have weak ties  

This design captures **parallel clinical activity**, not referrals.

### **Software Versions**
- **R 4.x**
- tidyverse  
- igraph  
- ggplot2  
- readr

##  Key Results

### **1. Largest Provider Hubs in NC**
Based on number of providers per ZIP:

| ZIP | Providers | Interpretation |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| **27157** | 1317 | Large Winston–Salem clinical cluster |
| **27834** | 1302 | Greenville (ECU Health hub) |
| **27710** | **1118** | **Duke Health System hub** |
| **28204** | 1081 | Charlotte medical cluster |
| **27103** | 1210 | Wake Forest hub |

---

**ZIP 27710** emerges as one of the **largest and most densely connected Medicare provider clusters** in the state.
## Main Network Visualization (Duke / ZIP 27710)

![Network 27710](https://github.com/kgahanduke-25/medicare-provider-network-nc/blob/main/3.network_zip_27710_duke_hub.png)


**Interpretation:**
- Dark blue nodes = highest co-practice strength
- Indicates highly interconnected clinical ecosystem around Duke Hospital
- Densely connected core (tertiary & specialty care)
- Peripheral clusters represent subspecialties or satellite clinics

##  Degree & Strength Distributions

### Strength distribution  
![Strength](https://github.com/kgahanduke-25/medicare-provider-network-nc/blob/main/5.strength_distribution_zip_27710.png)
-Strength Distribution = Weighted sum of connections — reflects similarity in Medicare caseloads.

Higher strength = providers practicing in parallel with very similar beneficiary volumes.

##  Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:
- Handling **1.25 million+ provider records**
- Cleaning and reshaping administrative CMS data
- Constructing a **10 million–edge** provider network
- Computing **network centrality metrics** (degree, strength)
- Producing publication-quality visualization
- Documentation & reproducibility using GitHub

---
**Policy relevance:**  
Mapping provider networks helps identify:
- Healthcare access clusters  
- Regional medical hubs  
- Potential care deserts  
- Patterns of clinical integration
